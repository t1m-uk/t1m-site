## Overview

This website is a personal project for my own amusement, experimentation, and educational purposes.  The code was written in plain text by an AI chatbot, with human oversight.

## Key Features:

- **Accessibility**: High-contrast design, skip links for easy keyboard navigation, and appropriate ARIA attributes to assist screen readers.
- **Semantic HTML**: Minimalist, widely-compatibly, standards-compliant code, using semantic elements to optimise machine readability.
- **Privacy**: No user data is collected.
