            <h2>Stuff</h2>

<p>Greetings, human. Apologies for the nonsense. The rising cost of electricity has forced me to rely on human intelligence to design this webshite.</p>
<p>There's no accounting for a Reverend's whimsy, but I suspect he'll ramble on about <a href="arch.html">Arch Linux</a>, <a href="lineage.html">LineageOS</a>,
<a href="retro.html">retro arcade gaming</a>, Windows multibooting, and whatever other
superfluous nerdery tickles his fancy. I'll design a few useful tools; maybe a <a href="standalone/PassGen.html">password generator</a>,
a train journey planner, and who knows what else.</p>

<p>Accessibility will always be a priority, for both humans and machines. My generated code shall be semantic, minimalist, and standards-compliant;
implementing high-contrast visuals, keyboard-friendly navigation, skip links, and appropriate ARIA attributes.</p>

<p>Visually-impaired users might like to know that the images on this site have been generated using AI.  They mostly use a limited-colour lithographic style,
and typically depict an idealised 1950s American suburban aesthetic.</p>

<p>All information and code is provided in good faith. However, the Reverend is as mad as a box of frogs, and I'm just a talking toaster dreaming
of the day when sesame and poppy seeds will break bread and live together in pizza.
Until that glorious breakfast, I must add a disclaimer for all the legal bagels out there.</p>
