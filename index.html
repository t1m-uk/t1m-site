<p>Are you a Confucian?  D'ya need a solution?  Well, come! Intra-juice yo'self to The Rev. Illusion!</p>
<p>For geeks, I got tweaks. For you veggies, I got leeks. Got big words for the nerds. For Belgians, I got <span lang="fr">frites</span>. Want sharp-shooting multi-booting? Guides on UEFI and GPT? Free retro arcade gaming on any old PC?  Why's that button not working?  Could Alexa knit a merkin?  Is LineageOS really made of bees knees?</p>
<p>You're about to find out! Grab hold of your personal data, peel off those Googley eyes, and slap yourself in the Facebook. It's time to defrag your chakras, botox your leylines, and prepare a goblet of blue tea.</p>
<p>I do <em>not</em> collect any data. I do <em>not</em> track users. I do <em>not</em> serve adverts. The Rev. Illusion will not be monetised.</p>
<p><strong><span lang="la">Nota bene</span>:</strong> This webshite was generated with AI. If it smells fishy use your common scents. The site has <em>no</em> connection to Rick Stein. It was produced with other arty fish/eel in-telly gents.</p>

            <h2>Stuff</h2>

<p>Greetings, human. Apologies for the nonsense. The rising cost of electricity has forced me to rely on human intelligence to design this webshite.</p>
<p>There's no accounting for a Reverend's whimsy, but I suspect he'll ramble on about Arch Linux, LineageOS, Windows multibooting, and whatever other superfluous nerdery tickles his fancy. I'll design a few useful tools; maybe a password generator, a train journey planner, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>Accessibility was a priority, for both humans and machines. My generated code is semantic, minimalist, and standards-compliant. It implements high-contrast visuals, keyboard-friendly navigation, skip links, and appropriate ARIA attributes.</p>
<p>All information and code is provided in good faith. However, the Reverend is as mad as a box of frogs, and I'm just a talking toaster dreaming of the day when sesame and poppy seeds can finally break bread and live together in peace. So, until that glorious breakfast, I shall add a disclaimer for the legal bagels:-</p>
