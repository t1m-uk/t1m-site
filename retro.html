            <h3>The Lost Generation of Arcadia</h3>

<p>Are ye olde enough to be retro? Do you remember the classic 1980s arcade games like 
Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Donkey Kong?</p>

<p>These coin-operated arcade machines were only popular for a decade or two, but represent an important era when inventive game-play
and ingenious programming launched us into distant worlds created with incredibly limited hardware (by today's standards).</p>

<p>The original version of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man#Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pac-Man used a ~3 MHz processor, 16 KB ROM, and 3 KB of RAM</a>.
Very roughly, a modern PC might have a CPU that runs a thousand times faster, with four million times as much RAM!
And that's not to mention countless other improvements in motherboard and CPU design over the years.</p>

<p>Sadly, these old machines will eventually fail. Fortunately great wizards and techno-historians have painstakingly documented or
reverse-engineered the circuit designs and ROMs, allowing modern PCs (and other devices) to emulate old hardware. Thus
ensuring our history is not lost forever!</p>

<h3>Not Legal Advice</h3>

<p>Copyright, trademark, and patent laws vary wildly across the globe. So nothing here is legal advice. But, in general, it
seems to be perfectly legal to download and use hardware emulators. For example, MAME is a well-respected project
that provides free arcade machine hardware emulators.</p>

<p>Acquiring game ROM data is a much greyer legal area. In general, copyright laws prohibit unauthorised copying
of game ROMs. However, in some jurisdictions the right to make personal backups or format-shift legitimately acquired media
is protected in law. And some regions are more relaxed about non-profit educational use, or historical archiving.</p>

<p>I will <strong>NOT</strong> provide any links to download MAME ROM sets or copyrighted games. Fortunately, there are a few
modern free and open-source games that are a great way to demonstrate MAME's hardware emulation without any legal issues.</p>

<h4>Not Legal Advice (from ChatGPT)</h4>

<p>I thought it strange that hardware ROMs can be copied and emulated freely, yet game ROMs are subject to stricter copyright.
I asked ChatGPT-4o why, and got a very <em>plausible</em> explanation:</p>














<article>
    
    <details>
		<summary>Click for ChatGPT-4o's response...</summary>
		
        <p>Your question delves into a nuanced area of intellectual property law. The legality of reverse-engineering and copying game ROMs hinges on several factors,
		including jurisdiction, intent, and the specific protections applied to different components of arcade systems.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Reverse-Engineering and Copyright</h2>
        <p>Reverse-engineering is generally legal in many jurisdictions under specific conditions, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fair Use (or Fair Dealing in the UK):</b> Reverse-engineering for purposes like research, education, or interoperability may fall under fair use/dealing exceptions.</li>
            <li><b>Preservation and Interoperability:</b> Projects like MAME argue their work is for archival or compatibility purposes, ensuring that old hardware designs aren't lost to history.</li>
            <li><b>Non-Copying of Protected Works:</b> When contributors reverse-engineer arcade systems, they are recreating the hardware's functionality without directly copying copyrighted blueprints or schematics. This does not necessarily violate copyright law because:
                <ul>
                    <li>Functional aspects (e.g., hardware design) are often protected by patents, not copyright.</li>
                    <li>Patents typically expire after 20 years, meaning many original arcade hardware designs are no longer protected.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Why ROMs Are Treated Differently</h2>
        <p>Game ROMs, by contrast, are subject to copyright because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Creative Expression:</b> Unlike hardware, the data stored in ROMs (game code, graphics, sounds) represents the creative and intellectual work of developers. Copyright law protects this kind of creative content.</li>
            <li><b>Direct Copying:</b> Extracting or distributing game ROMs involves duplicating the original copyrighted work, which is explicitly prohibited without permission.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. MAME’s Legal Stance</h2>
        <p>The MAME project itself adheres to certain principles to avoid legal issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Focus on Emulation:</b> MAME emulates hardware but does not distribute ROMs, ensuring its legality in most jurisdictions.</li>
            <li><b>Use of Public Domain or Licensed ROMs:</b> MAME officially supports ROMs that are either in the public domain, explicitly licensed for free use, or used with permission.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Why Is Reverse-Engineering Sometimes Permitted?</h2>
        <p>Courts have historically allowed reverse-engineering for purposes like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Interoperability:</b> Reverse-engineering is often allowed to make new software or hardware compatible with old systems (e.g., designing emulators).</li>
            <li><b>Preservation:</b> Projects focused on cultural or historical preservation (like MAME) may be seen more favourably than those aiming to profit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Jurisdictional Differences</h2>
        <p>Laws vary by region. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>United States:</b> The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) includes provisions allowing reverse-engineering in specific circumstances, but distributing ROMs is still prohibited.</li>
            <li><b>European Union and UK:</b> Similar protections exist for reverse-engineering for interoperability, but unauthorised copying of ROMs remains illegal.</li>
            <li><b>Japan:</b> Copyright law is stricter, with fewer allowances for reverse-engineering.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Reverse-engineering arcade hardware generally does not infringe copyright law because it focuses on replicating functional designs that may no longer be protected. Game ROMs, however, are copyrighted as creative works, and copying them without permission is usually illegal.</p>
		<p>MAME walks a fine line by focusing on emulation and explicitly avoiding unauthorised ROM distribution. This approach allows the project to operate legally while contributing to the preservation of gaming history.</p>

<h3>What is MAME?</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official MAME website</a>,
MAME was originally an abbreviation of Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.
These days, it has become a multi-purpose emulation framework for many other vintage devices.</p>

<p>MAME is constantly evolving. Newer versions emulate newer hardware, but require significant system resources.
Unlike most software, running the latest version of MAME is a huge mistake! Emulating old pre-internet hardware isn't a major security risk;
you don't need the latest updates to be safe. <em>Much</em> older versions of MAME are <em>perfect</em> for old hardware.</p>

<p>With <b>MAME 0.37b11</b>, even a 30 year old desktop PC (like a 266 MHz Pentium III with 16 MB of RAM) would be up to the job!
Or, with <b>MAME4droid</b>, old Android phones (like the Samsung Galaxy S2, released in 2011) can be transformed from a useless
bit of junk into a powerful handheld gaming system that would have been unimaginable in the 1980s! Of course, you'd probably want to get
a USB OTG (on-the-go) cable and connect your favourite USB gamepad or joystick.</p>

<p>While you can run MAME by itself, there are many other projects that use MAME as a backend:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>RetroArch</b> is a front-end (i.e. a user interface) application, providing access to various emulators and media players.</li>
	<li><b>Batocera.linux</b> is a live OS that can be installed on a USB stick or hard drive. It requires no knowledge of Linux. You simply need to copy the required files (such as game ROMs, BIOSes, etc.) to it.</li>
	<li><b>KnoppiXMAME</b> is also a live OS, but provides MAME emulation, and must be installed on a bootable CD.</li>
	<li><b>MAME4droid</b>, as mentioned above, is a MAME frontent for Android devices. </li>
</ul>

<p>Check out the links below, and rescue an old PC (or phone) today!</p>

<h4>MAME ROM Managers</h4>

<p>MAME game ROMs are essentially <code>.ZIP</code> or <code>.7z</code> files.</p>

<p>A <em>major</em> source of newbie confusion is that MAME versions are neither backwards- nor forwards-compatible! For example, if your game ROMs were designed to
work with <b>MAME 0.139u1</b>, they will probably not work correctly with <strong>any</strong> other MAME version. Fortunately, you can rebuild your game ROMs to work
with whichever MAME version you like by using a ROM manager.</p>

<p>Each version of MAME comes with a corresponding <code>.DAT</code> file. This contains the information a ROM manager needs, to know how to rebuild
your ROMs for that MAME version. (You can also download any <code>.DAT</code> files you need from the MAME website.)</p>


<h4>MAME ROM organisation</h4>

<p>Another source of confusion is in the three different ways that a MAME ROM set (your game collection) can be organised:</p>

<p>Since many arcade machines share similar hardware, many game ROMs share identical files (within the zipped image).
To save disk space, a ROM manager can <strong>merge</strong> or <strong>split</strong> your ROM set, to reduce file duplication.</p>

<p>The most <em>intuitive</em> way to organise your ROM set is the <strong>non-merged</strong> option. This requires the most disk space,
but ensures that every game ROM file is completely independent; neither relying on nor being required by any other ROM file.
This makes it possible to copy, move, or delete individual game ROMs without affecting any others.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul class="spaced-list">
<li><strong>MERGE</strong>: You can save disk space if you <strong>merge</strong> all of your individual ROMs into a single zipped file.
This ensures that there is only one copy of any file in your ROM/ZIP, which is shared by all the games that need it.
However, you can't simply add or remove individual games without rebuilding the entire ROM set.</li>

<li><strong>SPLIT</strong>: You can <strong>split</strong> your ROM set, so that each game has a 'parent' version, and 'child' (regional) variations.
You can delete any child variants you don't need, but the parent ROM is required by every child ROM.</li>

<li><strong>NON-MERGED</strong>: A <strong>non-merged</strong> ROM set is simple. Every game is self-contained within a separate ROM file.
This is not efficient in terms of disk space. However: you can delete any game or variant ROM file, without affecting any other;
you can copy individual game ROM files to other devices and expect them to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming you have a very small collection of very old games, I would suggest using a <strong>non-merged</strong> ROM set.</p>

<h3>8-bit Micros</h3>

<p>Maybe you had an 8-bit micro-computer, such as a ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, or Amstrad CPC, and played games like Jet Set Willy,
Arkanoid, Chase HQ, and Ikari Warriors? Maybe you played Ian Bond's text-based adventure games, like Island and The Base, or
used PAW (the Professional Adventure Writer) or GAC (the Graphic Adventure Creator) to create your own adventures?
The limited simplicity of these old computers made programming accessible; a generation of kids learnt to code!</p>

<p>In my mind, the Amstrad CPC6128 was the pinnacle of 8-bit computing (and not only because I owned one). It had a built-in
disc drive, making it quick, easy, and reliable to save and load your own programs. The instruction manual was a work of art.
It explained, in clear simple terms how to use a home computer. A reference section listed every BASIC command.
The appendices listed code for simple games and databases. It ran CPM; it was MIDI compatible; you could attach a mouse, joystick, stereo,
printer, EEPROMS, or the classic Multiface-II which allowed you to freeze execution, and use a hex-editor to directly modify
any part of the memory! You could <code>peek</code> and <code>poke</code> without limits!</p>

<p>Again, there are several emulators that mimic that classic 8-bit experience. These home computers don't even need
copyrighted games to be fun. Most had a BASIC interpreter built-in, so you can fire one up and start writing your own code right now,
just like in the good old days!</p>

			<h3>What is Batocera.linux?</h3>

			<p>Batocera is a free and open-source retro-gaming GNU/Linux distribution. It requires no knowledge of Linux.
			Essentially, you simply write the Batocera image file to a USB stick, then copy your game ROMs onto it.
			That USB stick should then boot on any PC, providing a portable gaming system!
			With a Linux bootloader (like GRUB), Batocera can be installed alongside Windows or other Linux OSes in a multi-boot setup.</p>

			<p>I had problems booting certain versions of Batocera on certain PCs.  However, <b>Batocera v5.18</b> has booted reliably
			on <em>every</em> PC I could find: old or new; 32 or 64 bit!</p>
			
			<p><strong>N.B.</strong> On the 4th October 2020, Batocera changed the way that versions were numbered.
			After <b>Batocera v.5.27</b> came a version known as both <b>Batocera v5.27.2</b> and <b>Batocera v28</b>.
			Since then, version numbers have continued incrementally: Batocera v29, v30, v31, etc.</p>
			
<hr>
			<h4>Installing Batocera v5.18 on a USB stick:</h4>
			
		<ol>
			<li>Download the Batocera v5.18 <code>.img.gz</code> gzipped image file.</li>
            <li>Extract the <code>.img</code> file. <i>(TIP: In Windows, use <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7-Zip</a>.)</i></li>            
            

            <li>Use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balena Etcher</a> to write the <code>.img</code> file to a USB stick.</li>
            <li>Boot the USB stick and wait for the file/partition setup to finish. Then, safely shut down or reboot.</li>
            <li>The USB stick will now have two partitions with the following patition LABELs:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>BATOCERA</strong> (FAT32) – Named <code>vfat</code></li>
                    <li><strong>SHARE</strong> (ext4) – Named <code>userdata</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			<li>Use any other Linux OS to copy your game ROMs (and emulator BIOSes) to the <b>SHARE</b> partition.</li>

        </ol>            
			<h4>Batocera's SHARE partition:</h4>
			
			<p>The <code>ext4</code> SHARE partition contains various (intuitively named) sub-directories, where you will need
			to copy your game ROMs, and BIOS files for any emulators.  With the right BIOS files, Batocera can emulate
			many 8-bit home computers from the Amstrad CPC to the ZX81; and many games consoles from the 1970s Atari 2600 to
			the Sega Megadrive, SNES, and beyond.</p>
			
			<p>However, Windows doesn't support <code>ext4</code> filesystems! You will need to use another Linux OS to access the SHARE partition.
			If you don't already use Linux, I suggest installing
			<a href="https://www.slax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slax</a>
			on another USB stick, and booting Slax to copy files to your Batocera USB stick.</p>

<hr>
			<h4>Installing Batocera on a hard disk</h4>

			<p>After installing Batocera on a USB stick, you can clone its BATOCERA and SHARE partitions
			to your hard drive (e.g. using <a href="https://gparted.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GParted</a>).
			On a dedicated arcade PC, Batocera should boot as expected.</p>
			
			<p>If you want to multi-boot Batocera alongside other OSes,
			you will need a Linux boot manager, such as the fairly ubiquitous GRUB.
			
			If you already run Linux, you are probably already using GRUB. You just need to add a boot entry for Batocera
			(as below), and regenerate the GRUB config file.</p>

			<p>If you only use Windows, I suggest installing a minimalist installation of Arch Linux.  Then you can use Arch to
			install GRUB, and configure additional boot entries for both Windows and Batocera.</p>

			<h4>Batocera GRUB boot entry (example):</h4>

<pre><strong>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</strong>
<code>
menuentry "Batocera" {
	insmod part_gpt
	insmod fat
	search --no-floppy --set=root --label BATOCERA
	configfile /EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg
}</code></pre>
